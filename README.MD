# Spearhead App
Trying to learn Svelte and while I'm at it, might as well create an app for to play Spearhead (especially for those who haven't purchased Fire + Jade cards).

## Mechanics
### Tactics and Commands
#### Goal
Primary purpose is to allow a player to use the tactics/cards without the physical copy. It will shuffle the cards and then allow the user to discard one card at a time. At any point, they may draw another card (maximum of 3). Should also have an "undo" button if time allows.
#### GW Rules
BATTLE TACTIC CARDS
At the start of the first battle round, each player draws a hand of 3 battle tactic cards. At the start of each subsequent battle round,
each player draws battle tactic cards until they once more have a hand of 3 battle tactic cards. Before they do so, they can discard any number of battle tactic cards in their hand. Cards are discarded face-up.
